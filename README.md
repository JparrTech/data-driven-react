# Data Driven React / Composable React
My first Data Driven React Project. In this project I learned:
* How to use components as a shell for props, maximizing reusable code.
* The importance of importing an object in Vite and not just banking on the relative path working. 
* How to pass a js object as a prop to a component. 
* Why destructuring your props might not always be a good idea.
* How to take an array of objects, use the map method to extract props from each object, then pass the props to our components - Aiding in separation of data (array of objects) and code structure (component).
* Why React wants us to use a key when passing props to components.
* How to spread an object as props using React {...{Object}} notation.
